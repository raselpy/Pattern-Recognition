# Pattern Recognition Algorithms from Scratch

This repository is a collection of implementations of algorithms and concepts I have learned from the **Pattern Recognition** course at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg (FAU)**. All algorithms are implemented from scratch using Python, focusing on the mathematical understanding and practical application of pattern recognition techniques.

## üöÄ Objectives

- Reinforce theoretical concepts of pattern recognition through practical implementation.
- Develop a deep understanding of key algorithms by implementing them without relying on external libraries.
- Build a comprehensive repository of educational resources for others interested in pattern recognition.

## üìÇ Contents

The repository includes implementations of various topics covered in the course, such as:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Gradient Descent**: Implements gradient descent for optimizing weights and bias.
   - **Cost Function**: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function.
   - **Parameter Initialization**: Initializes weights and bias manually.
   - **Custom Training Loop**: Includes a training loop with optional cost monitoring.
   - **Prediction**: Supports predictions on unseen data.
   - **Data Visualization**: Plots the regression line against test data for visualization.

2. **Logistic Regression**

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: To stay true to the "from scratch" approach, I use foundational libraries like numpy and matplotlib for numerical operations and visualizations. I also use scikit-learn, but only for supporting tasks like train_test_split.
